Functional Diagram of a Computer

The functional diagram of a computer illustrates how different units communicate and process data. The workflow describes the complete cycle of an instruction from input to output.

### 1. The IPO Cycle (Input-Process-Output)
All computers follow the basic IPO cycle:
*   **Input:** Data and instructions are entered.
*   **Process:** The computer works on the data based on the instructions.
*   **Output:** The result is displayed to the user.

### 2. Functional Units Description

#### A. Input Unit
Accepts data from the outside world and converts it into a machine-readable format for processing.

#### B. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
The CPU is the heart of the computer where actual processing takes place. It consists of:
1.  **Control Unit (CU):** It manages and coordinates all the operations of the computer. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them. It does not process data itself but directs other units.
2.  **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Responsible for:
    *   *Arithmetic Operations:* Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
    *   *Logical Operations:* Comparing numbers (Greater than, Less than, Equal to).

#### C. Memory Unit
*   **Registers:** Fast storage inside the CPU for immediate data access.
*   **Primary Memory (RAM):** Holds data and instructions currently in use by the CPU.
*   **Secondary Storage:** Used for long-term storage (files, programs).

#### D. Output Unit
Receives the processed results from the CPU (in machine code) and converts them into a human-readable form (text, graphics, audio).

### Data Flow Overview
1.  Input devices send data to the Main Memory.
2.  The Control Unit fetches data from Main Memory to the ALU for processing.
3.  Calculated results are sent back to the Main Memory.
4.  Final results are sent from Main Memory to the Output Unit.
