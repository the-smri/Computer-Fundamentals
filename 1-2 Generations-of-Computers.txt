Generations of Computers

The evolution of computers is often divided into five distinct generations, each characterized by a major technological development that fundamentally changed how computers operate.

1. First Generation (1940-1956): Vacuum Tubes
The first computers used vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. They were enormous, taking up entire rooms, and were very expensive to operate. They relied on machine language (binary) and could only solve one problem at a time.
Examples: ENIAC, UNIVAC, EDVAC.

2. Second Generation (1956-1963): Transistors
Transistors replaced vacuum tubes, ushering in the second generation. Transistors were far superior—allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient, and more reliable. Symbolic (assembly) languages replaced binary code, and high-level languages like COBOL and FORTRAN were being developed.
Examples: IBM 7094, CDC 1604.

3. Third Generation (1964-1971): Integrated Circuits
The development of the Integrated Circuit (IC) was the hallmark of the third generation. Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips (semiconductors), which drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers. Users interacted via keyboards and monitors mediated by an operating system.
Examples: IBM 360, PDP-11.

4. Fourth Generation (1971-Present): Microprocessors
The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the hand. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the computer on a single chip. This led to the Personal Computer (PC) revolution.
Examples: Apple Macintosh, IBM PC.

5. Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond): Artificial Intelligence
Fifth-generation computing devices, based on artificial intelligence (AI), are still in development, though there are some applications, such as voice recognition, that are being used today. The use of parallel processing and superconductors is helping to make artificial intelligence a reality. The goal is to develop devices that respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self-organization.
Examples: IBM Watson, Google Home, Siri.
