# Interacting With Computer

This guide covers the fundamental ways users interact with a computer system, managing settings, and applications. Essential knowledge for navigating the operating system effectively.

## 1. Uses of a Computer

Computers are versatile tools used for a wide range of tasks:

- **Information Access**: Browsing the web, research, and accessing news.
- **Communication**: Email, messaging apps, and video conferencing.
- **Content Creation**: Writing documents, editing photos/videos, and coding.
- **Entertainment**: Watching movies, listening to music, and gaming.
- **Data Management**: Storing files, organizing photos, and managing finances.

## 2. Control Panel & Settings

The **Control Panel** (and the modern **Settings** app in Windows) is the command center for your computer's configuration.

- **System Settings**: Change display resolution, sound settings, and power options.
- **Devices**: Manage printers, mouse, keyboard, and Bluetooth devices.
- **Network**: Connect to Wi-Fi, manage IP addresses, and troubleshoot internet issues.
- **Accounts**: Manage user profiles, passwords, and security options.
- **Personalization**: Change the background wallpaper, themes, and colors.

## 3. Installing and Uninstalling Applications

### Installing Applications

There are two main ways to install software:

1.  **Official App Stores**: (e.g., Microsoft Store, Mac App Store). This is the safest way. Search for the app and click "Get" or "Install".
2.  **Downloading Installers**:
    - Download the setup file from the official website (usually `.exe` or `.msi` for Windows, `.dmg` for Mac).
    - **Double-click** the downloaded file to run the installer.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions (often just clicking "Next" and accepting the license agreement).

### Uninstalling Applications

To remove a program you no longer need:

1.  Open **Settings** > **Apps** > **Installed Apps** (or **Control Panel** > **Programs and Features**).
2.  Find the application in the list.
3.  Click on the **three dots** (or right-click) and select **Uninstall**.
4.  Follow the prompts to remove the software.

## 4. Setting Default Applications

You can choose which specific program opens a certain type of file (e.g., making Chrome your default browser instead of Edge).

**Steps:**

1.  Go to **Settings**.
2.  Search for **"Default apps"**.
3.  You can either:
    - **Search for the file type** (e.g., `.pdf`) and choose the app you want to open it with.
    - **Search for the application** (e.g., Google Chrome) and set it as the default for all file types it can handle (like `.html`, `http`, `https`).

## 5. Basic Interaction Tips

- **Context Menu (Right-Click)**: Right-clicking on almost anything (files, desktop, taskbar) opens a menu with specific actions for that item (Copy, Paste, Properties, Delete).
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learning basic shortcuts saves time.
  - `Ctrl + C` / `Ctrl + V`: Copy and Paste.
  - `Ctrl + Z`: Undo the last action.
  - `Alt + F4`: Close the current window.
- **Power Management**:
  - **Sleep**: Keeps apps open but uses low power. Quick updates.
  - **Shut Down**: Completely turns off the computer. Good for long breaks.
  - **Restart**: Closes all apps and reboots the system. Essential for fixing minor glitches or after updates.
