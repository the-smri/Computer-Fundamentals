# Basics of Google Docs and Google Slides

As a web developer, mastering cloud-based productivity tools covers is essential for collaboration, documentation, and presenting project ideas to clients or teams.

## 1. Google Docs

Google Docs is a powerful, web-based word processor that allows for real-time collaboration.

### Key Features for Developers

- **Documentation & Specs**: Ideal for writing project requirements, technical specifications, and API documentation drafts before moving them to a codebase.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple people can edit the same document simultaneously. You can see what others are typing in real-time.
- **Comments & Suggestions**:
  - **Comments**: Highlight text to ask questions or leave notes without changing the content.
  - **Suggesting Mode**: Edits become suggestions that the owner can accept or reject (similar to Pull Requests in coding).
- **Version History**: Google Docs automatically saves every change. You can go to **File > Version history** to see who made changes and restore previous versions if something goes wrong.

### Basic Formatting

- **Headers**: Use properly structured headers (Heading 1, Heading 2) to auto-generate a Table of Contents.
- **Code Blocks**: You can insert code blocks (Insert > Building blocks > Code block) to format code snippets with syntax highlighting.
- **Exporting**: Documents can be downloaded as PDF, docx, or even HTML (though clean coding manually is preferred).

## 2. Google Slides

Google Slides is a cloud-based presentation tool used for creating visual slideshows.

### Uses for Developers

- **Client Presentations**: Showcasing website mockups, progress reports, or final deliverables.
- **Tech Talks**: Creating slides for team knowledge sharing or conference talks.
- **Wireframing**: Quickly arranging shapes and text to create low-fidelity wireframes or layout ideas.

### Key Tools

- **Themes & Layouts**: Start with a clean theme to ensure consistency.
- **Master Slides**: Edit the "Theme Builder" (View > Theme builder) to change fonts or logos across _all_ slides at once (similar to CSS for a website).
- **Transitions & Animations**: Add subtle animations to elements to make the presentation dynamic, but avoid overusing them.

## 3. General Google Workspace Tips

- **Sharing Permissions**:
  - **Viewer**: Can only read.
  - **Commenter**: Can read and leave comments.
  - **Editor**: Can make direct changes.
- **Auto-Save**: Both tools save automatically to Google Drive. You never need to hit "Ctrl + S".
- **Offline Mode**: You can enable offline access to edit documents without an internet connection; usually syncs when you reconnect.
