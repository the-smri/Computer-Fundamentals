# Video Conferencing Tools: Zoom

In the modern web development landscape, remote work and virtual collaboration are standard. **Zoom** has become one of the primary tools for daily stand-ups, client meetings, and remote pair programming.

## 1. Why Zoom for Developers?

- **Remote Work**: Many development teams are distributed globally.
- **Pair Programming**: High-quality screen sharing allows developers to code together in real-time.
- **Client Demos**: essential for showcasing website progress and getting live feedback from stakeholders.

## 2. Key Features

- **Screen Sharing**: The most used feature by developers. You can share your entire desktop or just a specific window (like VS Code or Chrome).
  - _Tip_: When demonstrating a website, make sure to zoom in your browser (`Ctrl + +`) so others can read the text clearly.
- **Remote Control**: You can give control of your mouse and keyboard to another participant. This is excellent for debugging code on someone else's machine.
- **Chat**: Send links, code snippets, or files during the meeting.
- **Recording**: Record meetings for absent team members or to review requirements later.

## 3. Meeting Etiquette

- **Mute by Default**: Always keep your microphone muted when you are not speaking to avoid background noise (typing sounds, fan noise).
- **Camera On/Off**: Turning your camera on helps build rapport with the team, but it's okay to turn it off if bandwidth is low.
- **Professional Background**: Use a blur effect or a clean virtual background if your physical environment is distracting.

## 4. Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

Mastering these will make you look like a pro during meetings.

- **Alt + A**: Mute/Unmute microphone.
- **Alt + V**: Start/Stop Video.
- **Alt + S**: Start/Stop Screen Sharing.
- **Alt + R**: Start/Stop local recording.
- **Spacebar**: Push-to-talk (hold spacebar to temporarily unmute yourself while holding it down).

## 5. Troubleshooting Basics

- **Audio Issues**: If nobody can hear you, check the arrow next to the Mute button and ensure the correct "Microphone" is selected.
- **Video Lag**: Close other bandwidth-heavy applications or turn off HD video in settings.
