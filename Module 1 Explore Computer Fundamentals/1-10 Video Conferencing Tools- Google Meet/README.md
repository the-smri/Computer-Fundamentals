# Video Conferencing Tools: Google Meet

Google Meet is a popular video communication service developed by Google. It is widely used by web developers and companies that rely on the Google Workspace ecosystem.

## 1. Why Google Meet?

- **No Installation Required**: Runs entirely in the browser. You don't need to download a separate app, making it incredibly accessible for quick client meetings.
- **Deep Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with Google Calendar and Gmail. Creating a meeting is as simple as adding an event to your calendar.
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security and encryption, leveraging Google's infrastructure.

## 2. Key Features

- **Screen Sharing (Present Now)**:
  - **Entire Screen**: Good for multi-window demonstrations.
  - **A Window**: Share just VS Code or your terminal.
  - **A Tab**: Best for sharing audio/video from a website, as it optimizes media playback.
- **Live Captions**: Real-time automated captions useful for accessibility or noisy environments.
- **In-Call Messages**: Chat panel for sharing links and snippets without interrupting the speaker.
- **Hand Raising**: A feature to signal you want to speak, preventing people from talking over each other.

## 3. Usage Tips for Developers

- **Calendar Events**: Always schedule meetings via Google Calendar. It automatically generates a Meet link that everyone can click to join.
- **Background Effects**: Use the "Visual Effects" settings to blur your messy room or replace the background before joining.
- **Troubleshooting**: If your mic isn't working, check browser permissions (click the lock icon in the URL bar) to ensure different websites have access to your microphone and camera.

## 4. Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
