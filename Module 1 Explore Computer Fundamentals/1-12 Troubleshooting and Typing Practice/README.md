# Troubleshooting and Typing Practice

This guide covers two overlooked but critical skills for any developer: the ability to solve problems independently (troubleshooting) and the physical skill of typing code efficiently.

## 1. Basic Troubleshooting Steps

Before asking for help, run through this mental checklist. It solves 90% of technical issues.

### The "Universal Fixes"

1.  **Restart It**: Whether it’s your computer, the browser, or a local server. Turning it off and on again clears temporary caches and stuck processes.
2.  **Check Connections**: Is the cable plugged in? Is Wi-Fi connected? simple physical layer issues are often the cause.
3.  **Update Software**: Ensure your browser, OS, or libraries are up to date.

### The Developer Troubleshooting Loop

1.  **Read the Error Message**: Don't just close the popup. Read it. It usually tells you exactly _what_ is wrong (e.g., "Unexpected token on line 45").
2.  **Google the Error**: Copy and paste the error message into Google. Add context keywords like the language or framework (e.g., "React unexpected token line 45").
3.  **Isolate the Problem**: Comment out code blocks until the error stops. This helps point to the exact lines causing the crash.
4.  **Check the Logs**: Look at the Console in DevTools or the terminal output.

## 2. Typing Practice

### Why it Matters

- **Speed**: Writing code at the speed of thought. You don't want your fingers to be the bottleneck for your ideas.
- **Health**: Proper technique reduces strain and the risk of Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI).
- **Focus**: Touch typing allows you to look at the screen (the code), not your hands, helping you spot errors immediately.

### Best Practices (Touch Typing)

- **Home Row**: Keep your fingers on `ASDF` (left) and `JKL;` (right).
- **Don't Look Down**: Force yourself to look at the screen. It will be slow at first, but it is the only way to build muscle memory.
- **Accuracy > Speed**: Focus on typing correctly first. Speed comes naturally with accuracy.

### Resources

Practice 10-15 minutes a day to see massive improvements.

- **Keybr.com**: Great for learning touch typing from scratch. It adapts to the keys you struggle with.
- **Monkeytype**: Minimalist and customizable. Good for testing your speed once you know the basics.
- **Typeracer**: Fun, competitive typing games against others.

### Target Developer Speed

- **Beginner**: 20-40 WPM (Words Per Minute)
- **Competent**: 50-70 WPM (Great for most coding tasks)
- **Pro**: 80+ WPM

## 3. Typing Challenge (Mandatory for Developers)

Whether you aim to be a Programmer, Web Developer, Chat Master, or any other professional, typing is a mandatory skill. You must take on this challenge: **Achieve a minimum speed of 35 WPM (Words Per Minute).**

### 1. Absolute Beginners

First, try to practice typing without looking at the keyboard (touch typing).

- Go to: [Typing.com](https://www.typing.com)
- Steps: `Sign Up` > `Sign up as a Student` > Follow the tutorials in serial order.

### 2. Intermediate Typists

If you already know a little bit of typing, practice typing actual code syntax.

- Go to: [SpeedCoder.net](https://www.speedcoder.net)
- Steps: Click `Start Now` > Select `HTML`, `CSS`, or `JavaScript` > Start practicing.

### 3. The Test

Finally, take a 3-minute test to verify your progress.

- Go to: [TypingTest.com](https://www.typingtest.com)
- **Target**:
  - **Good**: Above 35 WPM.
  - **Acceptable**: 25 WPM (Minimum requirement).
- **Rule**: You must **STOP** looking at the keyboard while typing.

_Challenge: Dedicate 4 hours a day for just 3 days, and you will see the system click into place. Let's see who can show the best speed before December 29th!_

_Troubleshooting builds resilience; typing skills build efficiency. Both are marks of a professional._
