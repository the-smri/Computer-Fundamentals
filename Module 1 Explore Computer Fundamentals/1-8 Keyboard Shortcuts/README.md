# Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

Mastering keyboard shortcuts is the single most effective way to increase your speed and productivity as a web developer. Minimizing mouse usage keeps your hands on the keyboard and your workflow uninterrupted.

These control the operating system and window management.

- `Win + Shift + S`: Take a screenshot (Snip).

## 2. Browser Shortcuts (Chrome / Edge / Firefox)

Since web developers live in the browser, these are crucial.

These work in almost all text editors (VS Code, Notepad, etc.) and fields.

- `Ctrl + A`: Select all text.
- `Ctrl + F`: Find text.
- `Ctrl + H`: Replace text.
- `Ctrl + Backspace`: Delete the entire word to the left of the cursor.
