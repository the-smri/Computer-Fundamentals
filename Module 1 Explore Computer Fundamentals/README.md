## Project Overview
This repository contains learning materials for introductory computer fundamentals. Each folder (1-1 → 1-12) represents a single lesson or topic area with supporting files such as notes, slides, exercises, and example code.

## Folder Summaries

### 1-1
Introduction to computers: basic definitions (hardware, software), history and evolution, types of computers, and an overview of how components interact to perform tasks. Good starting point for absolute beginners.

### 1-2
Computer hardware basics: components such as CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage, power supply, and expansion cards. Includes descriptions of form factors and how to identify/replace parts.

### 1-3
Software and operating systems: distinction between system software and application software, role of operating systems (process scheduling, memory management, file system), common OS examples and installation notes.

### 1-4
Number systems and binary: binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal conversions, signed vs unsigned numbers, and basic arithmetic in binary. Typical exercises include conversions and simple binary addition/subtraction.

### 1-5
Logic gates and boolean algebra: basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR), truth tables, boolean simplification, and simple combinational circuits. May include example circuits and K-map exercises.

### 1-6
CPU architecture and instruction cycle: CPU components (ALU, control unit, registers), instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle, pipelining basics, and a high-level look at instruction set architectures.

### 1-7
Memory and storage: types of memory (RAM, ROM, cache), storage media (HDD, SSD, optical), hierarchy, access times, and techniques for measuring and optimizing memory usage.

### 1-8
Input/output and peripherals: common I/O devices (keyboard, mouse, display, printers), device drivers, I/O methods (polling, interrupts, DMA), and interfacing basics.

### 1-9
Networking fundamentals: basic networking concepts (LAN/WAN), OSI and TCP/IP models, IP addressing and subnetting basics, common protocols (HTTP, TCP, UDP), and simple network troubleshooting.

### 1-10
Data representation and file systems: how data is represented (text, images, audio), file system overview (FAT, NTFS, ext4), file metadata, and common storage formats.

### 1-11
Security basics and best practices: introductory topics in computer security — authentication, authorization, encryption basics, malware types, and everyday hardening tips such as updates, backups, and safe browsing.

### 1-12
Troubleshooting and maintenance: systematic troubleshooting steps, common hardware and software issues, diagnostic tools, preventive maintenance, and creating recovery media/backups.

## How to Use This Repository
- Browse the folders 1-1 → 1-12 for materials associated with each topic.
- Each folder should include a README or an index file describing its contents and recommended order.
- Use the exercises provided in each folder to practice; solutions (if included) are typically placed in a `solutions/` subfolder or named with `.sol`/`-solution` suffix.
