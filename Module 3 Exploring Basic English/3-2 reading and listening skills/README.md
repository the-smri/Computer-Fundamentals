# Reading and Listening Skills

To grow as a developer, you must be able to read documentation (which is often dense) and listen to tutorials or meeting requirements accurately.

## 1. Reading Skills

Most of a developer's knowledge comes from reading documentation (`MDN`, `StackOverflow`, `Git` docs).

### Improvement Strategy

- **Active Reading**: Don't just scan; try to understand the _why_ behind the text.
- **Tech Blogs**: Read articles on `dev.to` or `Medium` to get used to the terminology.

### Test Sites & Resources

Test your general English reading comprehension here:

- **Oxford**: Great for academic and formal reading practice.
- **IELTS**: High-standard reading tests.
- **EnglishClub**: Fun and varied reading materials.
- **Test-English**: Interactive quizzes.

## 2. Listening Skills

You will watch hours of video tutorials (often in English accents you aren't used to) and attend voice calls.

### Improvement Strategy

- **Podcasts**: Listen to tech podcasts (e.g., "Syntax FM", "Shop Talk Show").
- **YouTube**: Watch tutorials with captions **OFF** first, then ON to check understanding.
- **Recorded Interviews**: Watch tech interviews to get used to the Q&A format.

### Test Sites & Resources

- **British Council**: Excellent listening practices for all levels.
- **Oxford & IELTS**: Standardized listening tests.
- **Test-English**: Short listening exercises with questions.
