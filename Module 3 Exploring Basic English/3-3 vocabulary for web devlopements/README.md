# Vocabulary for Web Developers

A strong vocabulary allows you to express your ideas precisely. In web development, accuracy is key.

## 1. General English Vocabulary

Improving your general word bank helps you sound more professional.

### Key Concepts

- **Antonyms & Synonyms**: Knowing similar and opposite words helps you avoid repetition (e.g., instead of saying "big" 5 times, use "large", "massive", "extensive").
- **Formal vs. Informal**:
  - _Informal_: "I wanna fix this."
  - _Formal_: "I would like to resolve this issue."
  - _Context_: Use formal language in documentation and client emails; informal is okay for team chats.
- **Avoid Redundancy**: Don't say "merge together" (merge means combine) or "new innovation" (innovations are new). Keep it concise.
- **Formal Interview Words**: Words like "Collaborated", "Spearheaded", "Optimized", "Resolved" sound better than "Worked on" or "Fixed".
