### [1-1 Computer Fundamentals](1-1%20Computer-Fundamentals.txt)

This document provides a concise history of the evolution of computers, covering key milestones from ancient manual counting tools to the dawn of the electromechanical age.

**Key Topics Covered:**

- **From Manual Counting to Mechanical Calculation:** The origins of computing with the Abacus (3000 BC) and Napier’s Bones (1617).
- **The Era of Mechanical Inventors:** The development of mechanical calculators like the Pascaline (1642) and the Leibniz Wheel (1685).
- **The Rise of Programmability and Data:** The introduction of punched cards with the Jacquard Loom (1804), Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine (1833), and Hollerith's Census Machine (1889).
- **The Electromechanical Age:** The transition to automatic calculation with the Harvard Mark I (1944).
